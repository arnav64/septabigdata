Big Data Analytics for SEPTA Regional Rail System

This project tries to look at trends in train delays using a dataset that SEPTA uploaded on Kaggle. We will first look at overall trends, then look at a particular station - University City, then look at a particular train- Train 395 and finally try to use a model to predict train delays.
